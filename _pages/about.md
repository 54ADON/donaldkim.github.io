# About Donald Kimtai

I'm an ICT Security Specialist with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Security and Forensics from Meru University of Science and Technology (2020-2024). Certified in Cybersecurity by ISC2, I specialize in vulnerability management, network security, and coding education. My work includes developing a 12-week coding curriculum adopted by schools, publishing cybersecurity research on Medium, and securing web applications through bug bounty programs, identifying vulnerabilities like IDOR and XSS. Passionate about aligning technology with organizational goals, I aim to build robust digital defenses and empower others through training in Python, JavaScript, and robotics frameworks like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
