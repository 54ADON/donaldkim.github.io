## üß© Problem Statement

Use Azure Functions to build serverless apps triggered by events such as HTTP requests, timers, and storage access.

---

## üîç Approach

1. Created Azure resources (Function App, Storage Account).
2. Configured a local .NET function project using Azure Core Tools.
3. Built three functions: one HTTP-triggered, one timer-triggered, and one integrating with Azure Blob Storage.
4. Deployed and tested the functions using `func` and Azure Portal.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Azure Portal
- Azure CLI
- Azure Functions Core Tools
- Visual Studio Code
- curl (for local function testing)
